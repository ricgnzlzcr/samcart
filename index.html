    			<h2>
    				About me
    			</h2>
    			<p>
    				I have a weird obsession with craftsmanship and enjoy creating software products that solve niche problems.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				I am a former product strategist/marketer who started coding when I wanted to build some of the products I was brainstorming. Coding became so much fun that I dropped my career in higher education in favor of writing software.
    			</p>
    			<hr>
    			<h2>My version of fun</h2>
    			<p>
    				I have an unhealthy relationship with my Kindle. Non-fiction is my poison of choice, but recently I've begun to incorporate fiction at night so that my mind shuts down. 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Favorite pastimes include watching soccer, gamifying my life (my wife thinks I'm 'eccentric'), and taking lots of walks. Movie-wise, I'll watch anything on Netflix where a reluctant hero overcomes an obstacle through grit and determination. Unsurprisingly, my favorite movie is Rocky.
    			</p>
    			<hr>
    			<h2>What I do</h2>
    			<p>
    				When I left higher education I took a job with a trade association with no technical staff, but with ambitions to build great software for their members.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				In my time at the company I've had the opportunity to manage and code an iOS app from prototype to launch. I'm immensely proud that it has directly led to 600+ members signing up at $50/mo. Additionally, I've built landing pages that have converted hundreds of new visitors into warm leads and regularly teach classes on identifying customer pain points to small business owners.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				I'm incredibly happy at my job. I have the freedom to make great products, while at the same time learning more about programming and product marketing. Like most millennials though, I'm driven to opportunities that stimulate growth. I want to take on tougher challenges and work with incredibly smart, driven people. That's why I'd like to learn more about the SamCart team.

    			<h2>Why I want to work at SamCart</h2>
    			<p>
    				Before joining Facebook Sheryl Sandberg was debating between joining a young Google and some more established companies. She asked Eric Schmidt for advice in building her pros/cons list. He covered the spreadsheet with his hand and told her not to be an idiot (always sage advice). Then he explained that only one criterion mattered--fast growth. He explained that when companies grow quickly there are more things to do than there are people to do them. When companies grow slowly or stop growing, there is less to do and too many people to not be doing them. That's where stagnation sets in. He told her, "If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat. You just get on." 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Currently I have no reason to job search, but I am always looking for growth. Customer growth. Personal growth. Career growth. When I stumbled on SamCart I liked the product and the direction it was headed. From the research I've done, it looks like a rocket ship that would allow my skill set to make an impact, but more importantly allow me to grow and learn from people smarter than me. I'm also a fan of the muse/online entrepreneur market and would love to help build a product that appeals to that segment.

    			<h2>Pros of hiring me</h2>
    			<ul>
    				<li><strong>I'm a gritty learner:</strong> I've taught myself HTML/CSS/Javascript/Objective-C/Java and product development when I needed to build or sell something. I may not be an expert at everything, but SamCart needs jack-of-all-trades that are quick learners in order to fill the holes left from fast growth.</li>
    				<li><strong>I'm results oriented:</strong> when you love to learn, you become fanatic about results. I've always been the weird employee who prefers focusing on big deliverables versus just doing what's on my job description.</li>
    				<li>
    					<strong>I'm relaxed:</strong> the people you work with are usually the people you see most each day. While I work hard, it's important for me to build great relationships with coworkers and just have fun every now and then. I'm always excited to grab a beer after work or play a round of ping pong. 
    				</li>
    			</ul>
    			<hr>
    			<h2>Cons of hiring me</h2>
    			<ul>
    				<li>
    					<strong>I won't stay for a paycheck:</strong> I place a lot of value on growth and fun when working at a company. Money is important, but never the most important factor. For some employers this is a con so I want to be transparent beforehand.
    				</li>
    				<li>
    					<strong>I've only programmed alone:</strong> I'm the sole developer at my company. That means that I've never had to write software with other people and that results in a small learning curve. Part of the reason I'm interested in SamCart is because of the opportunity to grow quickly as a developer by working with other programmers.
